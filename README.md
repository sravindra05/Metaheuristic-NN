## Overview

### Aim

To find weights of a neural network via heuristic based search algorithms like simulated annealing.

### Implementation

Standard Eagle strategy implementation with Levy flights for global search along with simulated annealing  and genetic algorithm as local searches

### Frameworks used

mlrose used to carry out output generation given custom weights and simulated annealing.
